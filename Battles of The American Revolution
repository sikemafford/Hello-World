	&nbsp;&nbsp;While Paul Revere was on his <a href="http://ahp.gatech.edu/midnight_ride_1775.html">moonlit ride</a> to alert the countryside, &nbsp;he was detained by British soldiers who were posted outside of town.&nbsp;&nbsp;  One placed a pistol to Revere's head saying that Revere may want to give up some reliable information or they would "blow [his] brains out."&nbsp;&nbsp;Revere offered that the soldiers would be confronted by 500 militiamen soon. &nbsp;&nbsp;Soon released after being deprived of his horse, Revere proceeded to Lexington on foot.  
	&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile,&nbsp; the news of approaching troops spread like wildfire throughout the countryside.&nbsp;&nbsp;Church bells rang and shots were fired into the night--all to alert the militia that had been assembling all night at <a href="https://www.history.org/Foundation/journal/Summer06/images/lex_34.jpg">Lexington green</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lexington green was a small,&nbsp;triangular section of land in the middle of town between forking roads--one of which led to the troop's destination: the Concord arsenal. &nbsp;&nbsp; A drum steadily rolled while the militamen,&nbsp;many ordinary family people (fathers, sons, grandfathers), &nbsp;came together.&nbsp;&nbsp;At dawn, Revere was allowed to pass through milita troops just ahead of the British soldiers.  &nbsp;&nbsp;They listened to a dreadfully slow and terrifying march of the seasoned, professional soldiers toward them.
	&nbsp;&nbsp;As the soldiers approached, the British troops saw what they would be confronting:&nbsp;&nbsp;several dozen men--a fraction of the British numbers.  
	&nbsp;&nbsp;The militiamen were ordered by the British commander to disperse.&nbsp;&nbsp;Greatly outnumbered, they began to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Britsh troops attempted to flank and contain them.&nbsp;&nbsp;The "shot heard 'round the world" rang out--the British said it was the militiamen; militiamen said it was the British who fired first. 
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Eight militiamen died.&nbsp;&nbsp;One British soldier was slightly wounded. &nbsp;&nbsp; The British commander,&nbsp; Pitcairn,'s horse was grazed by a bullet.

   &nbsp;As the British left Lexington and marched toward Concord,&nbsp;more militiamen began their march to intercept the troops.&nbsp;Upon seeing the superior numbers, the militiamen retreated to a nearby hilltop.&nbsp;The British entered Concord and began destroying munitions as well as forcing the reluctant locals to sell them victuals. &nbsp;The militamen's alarm and fury were enflamed because many of the colonists beleived that their homes had been set ablaze as well as their munitions destroyed.&nbsp;The militamen moved toward Conocord from the hilltop and confronted troops at <a href="http://www.emersonkent.com/images/lexington_concord.jpg">North Bridge</a>.&nbsp;Two colonists were killed.&nbsp;The British retreated to Concord to await reinforcements. &nbsp;The signaling bells continued to toll and the militia numbers continued to grow. &nbsp;&nbsp;Since the reinforcements were slow to arrive, the British retreated to Boston from whence they came. As they marched (and to their utter outrage), militia fire came guerrilla-style from behind objects rather than in the honorable, upright and open way to which the British were accustomed to being injected with lead.&nbsp;In the end,&nbsp;the war was an embarassment to the British and a triumph for the colonists.&nbsp;Britsh losses were 73; American were 49.

    A sleeping giant had been awoken. After Lexington and Concord,&nbsp;the tables were turned on the city of Boston.&nbsp;&nbsp;British troops were now being subject to the intimidation by a superior numbers of militiamen.
